Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \n\nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/), [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org/), [SBML](http://sbml.org/), and [cBioPortal](http://cbioportal.org/). *This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!* For example, Cytoscape is downloaded **16,000 times per month** by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our [>90% success rate](http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students [students](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and [mentors](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).\n\nFind out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB.

      "description": "Data collection is a key component of social good efforts ranging from polio elimination to rainforest conservation and Open Data Kit (ODK) helps thousands of organizations collect data quickly, accurately, offline, and at scale. Users of ODK software include Red Cross, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control, Jane Goodall Institute, Gates Foundation, the Carter Center, and many others.\n\nThe ODK ecosystem has several tools that are used to collect data. For GSoC, we will focus on the popular Android form filling client ([ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect)), the desktop downloader ([ODK Briefcase](https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase)), and a Android-based data collection hub ([ODK Services](https://github.com/opendatakit/services)).\n\n** Examples of ODK projects are below. Contribute and make the world a better place! **\n\n* Hutan Aceh in Indonesia is home to tigers, elephants, orangutans, and rhinos. EIA International and local activists protect it by documenting forest crimes with ODK. The geo-tagged forms, rich with photos, provide the evidence needed to save habitat. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/109241884).\n* Evaluating global health programs involves collecting, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data. Population Council, Marie Stopes Uganda, and Gobee Group use ODK to streamline the process. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/38123850).\n* The Jane Goodall Institute uses ODK to empower local communities to better manage and monitor their forests. ODK lets these communities connect directly with the global carbon marketplace and demonstrate the concrete benefits of their efforts to protect the forest. [Watch video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CNXv8EEs0P8). \n* The Carter Center uses ODK to get the real-time data needed to assess elections. Over the last six years, ODK has been used to monitor elections in Liberia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Nepal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, and Tunisia. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-CGzo3m4PA).\n* For governments working to end polio, access to accurate and timely information makes a world of difference. ODK is used in Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and South Sudan as a key tool in mass polio vaccination campaign quality control. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zROyvrvt-zk).",

The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.\n\n### The lab\nThe Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to programming robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <https://lab.open-roberta.org/> is online and has had more than 100.000+ visits in 2017 across 135 countries.\n\nThe backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the form of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 7 different robot plugins:\n* EV3 LEGO Mindstorms \n* NXT LEGO Mindstorms\n* BBC micro:bit \n* Calliope mini\n* Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based\n* NAO, a humanoide robot\n* Bob3\n\n### Outlook\nWhile the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.",

      "description": "OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects that are used by researchers and engineers around the world to study our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like the [Hubble Space Telescope](http://www.nasa.gov/hubble), the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/) or the [Solar Dynamic Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), developing very sophisticated numerical models (eg. [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft (eg. [HORIZONS](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi)). The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpenAstronomy is currently formed by [12 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;\n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.\n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And [more](http://openastronomy.org/members/)!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

      "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.\n\n**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\n**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.\n\nWe recommend to read http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/writing-a-proposal/",

      "description": "In the summer of 2008 the [Metropolitan City of Rome](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/) decided to start a **free of charge and public Wi-Fi network** to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\n\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.",

      "description": "# Why Oppia?\nOppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. \n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!",

      "description": "# Why PEcAn? #\nClimate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.\n\n\n # How does PEcAn do that? #\n\nPEcAn consists of **1)** state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, **2)** a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and **3)** a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.",

These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.\n\nPCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:\n\n###### PCP Collectors\nThese are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.\n\n###### PCP Monitors\nThese are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.\n\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.",

Our global community of contributors ensures that end-users receive a stable, secure, and infinitely customizable product that's easy to deploy and maintain while also being fun and simple to use.\n\n## Why choose phpBB?\nOriginally released in 2000, the latest version of the phpBB software has evolved to include an extensive permissions system, user groups,  hierarchical subforums, file attachments, intuitive notifications, OAuth authentication, support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server), and a variety of other features. The phpBB Customization Database of styles and extensions offers administrators endless ability to adapt the software to their needs.\n\nOur strict security practices have resulted in a hardened product with a proven track record greatly exceeding that of our commercial competitors. Likewise, our coding guidelines and collaborative development model ensure that code quality is a top priority while encouraging constant developer learning and growth.\n\n## phpBB and Google Summer of Code\nWe are proud to have participated in the GSoC program during four prior years. The goal of our mentors is to ensure that all students have a smooth and fulfilling experience. Former phpBB GSoC students have flown across the world to meet the rest of our team during our annual hackathon and have gone on to become long-term contributors to the project, some even joining the core development team.

You should outline what you would like to implement, and how it integrates with the phpBB software. You do not need to specify all implementation details, however (e.g.: if you need some data that is expensive to generate, it is important that you mention the need to cache the sorted data, however you don't need to specify the sorting mechanism).\n\n**Timeline**: Your project should be broken down into tasks with specific milestones.

      "description": "PMD is a static code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 8 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in all the above languages and additionally in C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, and Swift.\n\n# Usage\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.",

It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.\n\nAn enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate. There are active PostgreSQL instances in production environments that manage many terabytes of data, as well as clusters managing petabytes. Some general PostgreSQL limits are included in the table below.",

The status gets updated each time the pull request title is changed.\n\n# How does Probot work?\n\nProbot is a Node.js framework based on the [Express Server framework](http://expressjs.com/). It provides APIs to subscribe to events that are happening on GitHub to run your custom code. For example, the `WIP GitHub App` mentioned above is built with Probot in only about 20 lines of code: https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master\n\n# Why apply for Probot?\n\nYou will create your very own GitHub application, your own product that you can add to your portfolio at the end of the summer. While working on your own app, you will interact with the Probot core team and learn how to contribute to the core project itself.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you :)",

Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.",

      "description": "# What is Quill.org?\nQuill.org is an education technology nonprofit that helps over 750,000 learners around the world improve their writing and critical thinking skills through innovative technological approaches. We're grateful to have support from organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, and AT&T Foundation.\n\n# Improving Education with Innovative Technology\nQuill was recently featured in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers) and the [Google Machine Learning blog](https://blog.google/topics/machine-learning/quillorg-better-writing-machine-learning/) for our work applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to helping learners become better writers and critical thinkers. We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers. \n\nLearners begin by completing a [diagnostic activity](https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic) that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even [special versions of the diagnostic](https://medium.com/writing-with-quill/quill-org-launches-ell-diagnostic-ac2dd65de692) for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)\n\nQuill has a variety of activity types, including [a real-time classroom lessons mode](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons), [a sentence construction tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect), [a proofreading practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader) and [a grammar practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar).\n\nEach tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\n# What's Next?\n\nUp until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.",

We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.\n  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute\n - You can also choose a “backup” idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.",

      "description": "Red Hen Lab is a distributed consortium of researchers in multimodal communication, with participants all over the world. We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations, and also junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis. \n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).",

Be realistic and honest with yourself about what you think you will be able to accomplish in the course of the summer.  Provide a detailed list of the steps you believe are needed, the tools you propose to use, and a weekly schedule of deliverables.  Clear and proper documentation can take much longer than expected.\n\nIf you are proposing a machine learning project, base the proposal on techniques that have already been successful in other similar projects.  Include as much information about previous research and results as possible.  Accuracy measurements will be required, and they should be as automated as possible.\n\nPlease be prepared to follow code formatting standards closely and to work with Singularity (virtual Linux system) images throughout the summer.",

Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.\n\nOur server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.\n\nThe server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.\n\nRocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  \n\nChat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.",

It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\n\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\n\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\n\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\n\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.",

Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations.

At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.",

Based on that, we will ask you a realistic planning for the 12 weeks of GSoC, including the deliverables expected at mid-term and at the end of the GSoC. In order to be complete, we also expect you to make a pull request, for example for a bug fix. The purpose is to ensure you know how to use Git, and that you had a look at our coding conventions.\n\nWe don't expect you to produce a perfect application without any help at all. We strongly encourage you to discuss your plans and your application with us while you're preparing it, to ensure your ideas align well with our own thoughts on the tasks, and that your objectives are achievable. It is also the perfect chance to already get to know your potential mentors and the rest of the team. Don't hesitate to join the IRC channels and ask questions: keep in mind that there are no stupid questions!\n\nIn order to help you structure your application, we summarized our requirements in a template: http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/GSoC_Application",

It has a clean and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory safe by default.\n\nAlthough inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.",

Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").\n\nNaturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code.

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.",

If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ).

      "description": "The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, there exists many different extensions of JPF that capture different functionalities, including verification, testing, debugging, program repair and security analysis.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.",

Note that not all projects require a deep understanding of Java or JPF. Please look at the project descriptions to determine which skills are most important.\n\nJPF is a software verification tool. It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects not being familiar with formal methods is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.\n\nYou can find some project ideas on our [project ideas](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2018-Project-Ideas) page. Please note that this list is not exclusive. If you are interested in a project that is not listed here, and it is relevant to JPF, we would love to hear about it. You can either email it to us or share your idea in our mailing list. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding JPF and the GSoC program do not hesitate to email us. Join our IRC channel #jpf on freenode to engage in a discussion about JPF.\n\nIn order to apply to our organization, you need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase (03/12 - 03/27). Check out the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) page for more information.",

[ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) is a *discrete-event, packet-level network simulator* with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.",

      "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFcWh2IWqhICh4YIFNwtKUaWWXifaBB67rjPxbYzjbE/edit?usp=sharing).",

That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.\n\nSimplify complex log data\n\nEven if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.\n\nDatabases destinations\n\nIf you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, even Oracle!), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis, if that's what you are after.\n\nMessage queue support\n\nsyslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.\n\nSupport language bindings\n\nWant to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.",

      "description": "Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.\nThe goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.\nThis goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams.  On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis.  With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. \nTools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.",

TLA+ is especially well suited for writing high-level specifications of concurrent and distributed systems.\n\nPlusCal is an algorithm language that, at first glance, looks like a typical tiny toy programming language.

A PlusCal algorithm is translated into a TLA+ specification, to which the TLA+ tools can be applied.\n\nThe principal TLA+ tools are the TLC model checker and TLAPS, the TLA+ proof system. All the tools are normally used from the Toolbox, an IDE (integrated development environment). Go to the TLA home page to find out more about TLA.",

While we are funded nationally, our users are international, with only 40% of our traffic coming from within the United States. Last month we had over 3,500 users. We are committed to open-source software from the beginning and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our [static interval tree](http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree), [KM statistics](http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier) and [ICGC plugin](http://xena.ucsc.edu/integration-icgc-portal/)). \n\nStudents we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger [UCSC Genomics Institute]( https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease. We are committed to working with students to ensure that they gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and useful code to the project. \n\nWe are interested in finding long-term collaborators and growing our development team.

ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.\n\nReleases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip. ViSP is also packaged as binary packages for Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, OSX, iOS, and for ROS framework.\n\nThe user site is at https://visp.inria.fr/.

      "description": "**webpack is a module bundler**. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n## Overview\n\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM). \n\n## What makes webpack unique?\n\n**Extensibility** webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system. \n\n**Focused around Web Performance** webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\n**Built in JavaScript** webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve. \n\n**Used at Scale** webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\n**Community Owned** webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling",

An open-source bookmarking tool for great thinkers: the researchers, scientists, academics, students, polemics, publishers, reporters, and writers who want to make the world a better place using facts, research, and verified information.\n\nWith Memex  we want to help you ease the frustration of not being able to find something you’ve seen online, whether it’s a website, a post on social media, a useful comment, or important quote.\nUsers can find things again, by searching for every word of every website visited – plus they can filter by domain, custom tags or time.\nAlso users can create links to highlights of articles, they can send to other people.  \n\nMemex is built with full privacy and data ownership in mind. \nAll data is stored locally on a user’s own computer. You can also pause indexing, or to blacklist domains or URLs. \n\nOur long-term vision is to battle online misinformation, by enabling users to build on the past web-research of other people, and break out of their filter bubbles by comparing multiple different opinions.

We're asking bc unfortunately, we don't have the resources to help you learn basic programming skills in the languages/frameworks we use. Please give us a feel for the kind of projects you have been working on so far.\n4) Think equally carefully about what you want to learn in the next year, so we can help you achieve your learning goal during the summer and thereafter. \n5) For a successful application a (well) thought out plan on how to reach your project's goal is necessary.  6) #5 will require you already start hacking on some smaller things/preparations beforehand. Also it helps us getting a feel for how we work together :)\n\n### Next Steps\nStill interested? Great!\n\n1) Drop by in our Slack channel and say 'hi' in #intros. Include some trivia information about you and add the answers to the questions 3 & 4.\n2) Then we'll find a suitable test issue to work on for you\n3) Happy hacking :)",

Indeed, X.Org is much broader than just the X Window System. Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.\n\nToday, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.\n\nCome help us make the future more open!",

Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.\n    Goals: What is the goal of the project, a project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take to much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skill and deduct that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this perhaps its better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.\n    What does it touch in Kodi: Think about what parts of the code this may touch, Kodi is a big application and a lot of the code is spread out and very complex. If a project touches to much it may be impossible to complete.\n    Requirements: What is needed to complete the project, what code language knowledge what hardware etc.\n    Possible mentors: Place to add possible mentors (Team-Kodi will add this).",

It should be easy to customize xi editor, whether\n  by adding plug-ins or hacking on the core.\n\nPlease refer to the [November 2017 roadmap](https://github.com/google/xi-editor/issues/437)\nto learn more about planned features.",

      "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",
